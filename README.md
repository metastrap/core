# metastrap:core

A library for bootstrapping projects of various frameworks with configurable features and options.

## Intro

All the Frameworks for web-development comes with a number of addons / plugins / libraries and other dependancy frameworks. The repo might contain some examples of them for checkout, but it is hard to mix and use multiple examples simultaneously. This project is inspired by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io). Initial scope covers [Next.Js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). In future, we aim to extend this funtionality for other frameworks as well based on the wishes of the dev community.

The UI version is hosted in [metastrap.github.io](https://metastrap.github.io).
Contributions as welcome.
